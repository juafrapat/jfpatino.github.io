  abstract={Neutrino-nucleus quasielastic scattering is studied in the plane-wave impulse approximation for three nuclear models: the relativistic Fermi gas (RFG), the independent-particle shell model (IPSM), and the natural orbitals (NO) model with Lorentzian dependence of the excitation energy. A complete study of the kinematics of the semi-inclusive process and the associated cross sections are presented and discussed for 40Ar and 12C. Inclusive cross sections are also obtained by integrating the semi-inclusive expressions over the outgoing hadron. Results are consistent with previous studies restricted to the inclusive channel. In particular, a comparison with the analytical results for the RFG model is performed. Explicit expressions for the hadronic tensor and the 10 semi-inclusive nuclear responses are given. Theoretical predictions are compared with semi-inclusive experimental data from T2K experiment.},

  abstract = {We present the results of semi-inclusive neutrino-nucleus cross sections within the plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA) for three nuclear models: relativistic Fermi gas, independent-particle shell model, and natural orbital shell model in comparison with the available CC0π measurements from the T2K, MINERνA, and MicroBooNE collaborations where a muon and at least one proton are detected in the final state. Results are presented as a function of the momenta and angles of the final particles, as well as in terms of the imbalances between proton and muon kinematics. The present semi-inclusive formalism is based on fully relativistic microscopic calculations and numerical integrations to produce both lepton and hadron kinematics without relying on further approximations. The analysis reveals that contributions beyond PWIA are crucial to explain the experimental measurements and that the study of correlations between final-state proton and muon kinematics can provide valuable information on relevant nuclear effects such as the Fermi motion and final-state interactions.},
